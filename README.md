**Prevent Alibaba Group from tracking your visits to other websites**

Alibaba Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to limit how much Alibaba Group is able to track you online. It works by automatically isolating your browsing on Alibaba-owned websites using the built-in tab container system.

## Forked from Krober's Amazon Container  

Krober's [Amazon Container](https://github.com/krober/contain-amazon/) was the inspiration and template for this extension.
